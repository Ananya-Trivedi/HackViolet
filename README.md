## Project Documentation
The following Notion link documents the project proposal, technologies used and features incorporated (including screenshots of the live app).

This app hasn't been hosted on a live server as of now; however the Notion documentation should give an overview of the functionalities.

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project are the many protests that have happened around this country, and after surveying students, we found that it isn't easy to find how to support causes, and that they would support their causes and attend protests a lot more if it was easier.

## What it is
With United To Act(UTA), users can 
-Find events, workshops, marches, protests and fundraisers to be involved in the local community!
-Type in your city in the search bar, or use the geolocation feature to find the closest events near you!
-Add markers onto the Google Map if you're attending a movement for an impactful cause, or an informative session. -Let others join you too!
-View markers to navigate to locations you're willing to head to with the purpose of supporting an important cause, a charity event, a sporting event or even a reading club! 

## About the technologies
What are React Hooks?
Reach Hook APIs essentially act as an alternative way of writing class based components, state management and lifecycle methods. 

Originally, for instance, we could work with local states, effect and context only with classes. However, we cna now employ useState, useEffect and useContext. 

It helps us write cleaner and more concise code! However, there's a couple things we need to remember:
- NEVER call Hooks from withing a loop, condition or a recursive function.
- Only call them from React functional components.
- Hooks can call other Hooks.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Successfully integrated the Google APIs.
