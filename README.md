## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project are the many protests that have happened around this country, and after surveying students, we found that it isn't easy to find how to support causes, and that they would support their causes and attend protests a lot more if it was easier.
## What it does
With United To Act(UTA), users can 
-Find events, workshops, marches, protests and fundraisers to be involved in the local community!
-Type in your city in the search bar, or use the geolocation feature to find the closest events near you!
-Add markers onto the Google Map if you're attending a movement for an impactful cause, or an informative session. -Let others join you too!
-View markers to navigate to locations you're willing to head to with the purpose of supporting an important cause, a charity event, a sporting event or even a reading club! 

## How I built it
We built it using React app.
## Challenges I ran into
The biggest challenge we ran into was probably lack of time, and other things happening in our lives.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We have the APIs working and users can pinpoint locations
## What I learned
We all learned a couple new technologies, and developed out skills in others.
## What's next for United To Act
We are looking to add some new features, such as groups and posting, enhancing the users experience with the project.
